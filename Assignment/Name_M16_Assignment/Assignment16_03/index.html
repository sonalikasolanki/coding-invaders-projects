<!-- 1. Initialize the productIDs array with the given values: [10, 12, 15, 19, 24, 28, 30, 45, 50, 65, 77, 99].

2. Initialize the targetProduct with the product ID to be searched, which is 19 in this case.

3. Initialize the left pointer to 0 and the right pointer to the last index of the productIDs array.

4. Start a loop that continues until the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer:
   a. Calculate the mid pointer as the average of the left and right pointers: mid = (left + right) / 2.
   b. If the productIDs[mid] is equal to the targetProduct, return mid as the position of the product.
   c. If the productIDs[mid] is less than the targetProduct, set the left pointer to mid + 1 to search the right half of the array.
   d. If the productIDs[mid] is greater than the targetProduct, set the right pointer to mid - 1 to search the left half of the array.

5. If the loop ends and the targetProduct is not found, display "Out of stock".
